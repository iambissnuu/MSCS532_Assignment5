# Quicksort Algorithm: Deterministic and Randomized Versions

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of two versions of the Quicksort algorithm using Python. Quicksort is a fast and efficient sorting method that follows the divide and conquer principle. The two approaches explored are:

- **Deterministic Quicksort**: Always picks the first element as the pivot.
- **Randomized Quicksort**: Selects a pivot randomly for each recursive call.

The goal of this project was to observe how pivot selection affects the algorithm's performance on different types of input data.

## Contents

- `deterministic_quicksort.py` – Python file for the deterministic implementation.
- `randomized_quicksort.py` – Python file for the randomized implementation.
- `performance_test.py` – Script that runs both versions on various input cases and records execution times.
- `Quicksort_Report.pdf` – The final report with implementation details, theoretical analysis, performance results, and conclusions.

## How to Run the Code

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the performance test script:

```bash
python performance_test.py
